<h3>Jacob Cook, Rafael Ramirez, Sarah Diaz, Candy Arce</h3>
<p>Team Golden Girls is a group of young Computer Science students working together to create an engaging platform fighter experience. We're inexperienced, but we've worked hard on this project, and we're proud of the progress we've made as a team and individuals to get to where we are now. We've learned a lot from this experience, and we hope you see that in our work. Thank you!</p>
