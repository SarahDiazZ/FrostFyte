         <h1> FrostFyte Design Architecture </h1>
         <hr>
      </div>
      
      <h2><b>Project Overview</b></h2>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li>FrostFyte is a platform fighter in which players are tasked with knocking opponents into the blast zone, using a variety of attacks to damage them and send them flying further.</li>
            
            <p></p>

            <li>The game is a take on the traditional fighting game formula that incentivises a greater emphasis on movement and stage control.</li>
            
            <p></p>

            <li>The game is built in GameMaker, using Platform Fighter Engine.</li>
         </ul>
      </div>

      <br>

      <h2><b>Key Architectural Drivers</b></h2>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li>FrostFyte features a large variety of assets,
               abilities, and requirements.</li>
            
            <p></p>

            <li>As such, we’ll need an architecture that can
               support lots of data, in the form of sprites,
               scripts, and other assets.</li>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <li>We’ll also need to have easy access to the
               relevant data at any given time.</li>
         </ul>
      </div>

      <br>
      
      <h2><b>Architectural Style Choices</b></h2>
      <div>
         <b>Two</b> options pique our interest with that goal in mind:
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
         <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/data_centered_architecture.htm">
            <img class = "blackboard" src="Architecture/blackboard.png" alt="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/data_centered_architecture.htm">
         </a>
         <p><u><b>Blackboard:</b></u> A system-active architecture in which
         computational processes are determined by data
         status.</p>
      </div>

      <br>

      <div>
         <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/data_centered_architecture.htm">
            <img class = "repository" src="Architecture/repository.png" alt="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/data_centered_architecture.htm">
         </a>
         <p><u><b>Repository:</b></u> A client-active architecture with in which
            computational processes are independent.</p>
      </div>

      <h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
      <div>
         <p>We’ve chosen a Repository Architecture, as an
            architecture accustomed to user input would be
            optimal for a fighting game, and the independence of
            computational process will be helpful for the
            constantly shifting game states at play.</p>
