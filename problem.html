        <p> FrostFyte (title pending) is a prototype for a browser-based platform fighter developed in Platform Fighter Engine. 
            The project is intended to be a test for a future browser-based platform fighter to be developed in the same engine, called Math Snacks Smackdown. 
            FrostFyte will feature one character, and one stage. 
            In addition, the project will feature 1v1 local multiplayer. 
            Platform fighters are an inherently dense and complex genre, which means FrostFyte will have a focus on simplicity and ease of understanding of the genre’s core mechanics.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> One such mechanic is combat. 
            In most platform fighters, including FrostFyte, players are assigned a number of lives and a percentage that represents their total damage. 
            This percentage starts at zero, and as a player is damaged, it rises. As it rises, the player is knocked back further by attacks. 
            The player’s goal is to use their attacks to knock opponents off the stage (a small landmass that players fight on), and into the blast zone (a rectangle surrounding the screen). 
            When a player is launched into the blast zone, they lose a life, and when they lose all their lives, the match ends and the player who still has lives is the winner. 
            In platform fighters, characters have a litany of attacks to use, and each serves a purpose in the player’s toolkit. Many games provide unique variations of the genre’s mechanics, but some consistently present attack varieties include:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Normals: Basic attacks fighters can use from the ground with a simple input. 
            Usually fast, light attacks used to create openings for more powerful moves.
        </p>
        <p> Aerials: Basic attacks similar to normals, but for use in the air. 
            Used to either fight your way back to the stage, or defend it from opponents.
        </p>
            Specials: More complex attacks which serve a unique purpose for the fighter. 
            These range from movement options used to control space, to projectiles used to create distance, to status effects used to harm the opponent, to simply powerful attacks.
        </p>
        <p> Strong Attacks: Slow, powerful moves intended for defeating high-percentage opponents. 
            These are often the most damaging moves in a character’s arsenal, but leave massive openings that can be exploited by opponents to turn the tide.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> On top of moves, characters in platform fighters generally have alternate costumes, intended to provide variety and make matches between two of the same characters more easy to read for the player. 
            As FrostFyte is only planned to feature one character, the project will necessitate at least one alternate costume in order to prevent confusion between players. 
            Speaking of FrostFyte’s playable character, they’re intended to be a relatively simple, easy-to-understand fighter that introduces players to the intricacies of platform fighter mechanics, without overwhelming them with information.

            In addition to characters and moves, most platform fighters have a number of stages for players to do battle on. 
            These stages usually offer a variety of platform layouts, which change the shape of the battlefield in order to provide variety and allow for creative use of the environment. 
            FrostFyte will feature one stage, with a singular floating main platform that constitutes the majority of the landmass, and two smaller floating platforms slightly higher above the main stage. 
            This is a common layout for platform fighter stages, and is popular among fans of the genre for two reasons: firstly, the simplicity of the layout makes the battleground easy to understand, but the additional platforms provide an opportunity for strategy and consideration of the battleground. 
            Second, this layout allows for a fair arena for competitive play. As these games are very popular with competitive gamers, allowing for a relatively non chaotic battle is optimal for a game with very limited stage options.
