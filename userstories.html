         <h3>1. Enhance Competitive Gaming</h3>
         <p>As user 1, eliminating gimmicks would be preferable so that the characters can be managed only on one platform.<br><br>

         <strong>Elaboration:</strong> Multiple platforms allow for more competitive gaming. As far as our project goes, additional platforms would be removed so that the characters only move along one flat surface. Eliminating platforms is highly desirable but not necessary.<p></p>

         <strong>Constraints:</strong> With only one platform, the game is less competitive with less objects to move around.<p></p>

         <strong>Effort Estimation: </strong> 2 person-hours<p></p>

         <strong>Acceptance test:</strong> The characters will be able to move only along one flat walk off stage. Meaning that there are no instances of characters coming off a stage.</p>
         
         <p></p>
         <br>

         <h3>2. Unique Character Design</h3>
         <p>As user 2, a more desirable game requires unique characters so that users can differentiate their character from their opponent’s character. <p></p>

         <strong>Elaboration:</strong>  Changing the physical appearance of characters will make it easier for the player to distinguish their fighting character. <p></p>

         <strong>Constraints:</strong> none<p></p>

         <strong>Effort Estimation:</strong> 2 person-hours<p></p>

         <strong>Acceptance test:</strong> When playing the game, there will be a difference between opponents.</p>

         <p></p>
         <br>

         <h3>3. System Uniqueness </h3>
         <p>As user 3, a unique design is important so that there is a difference between the setting and characters of other games and for it to attract a user’s attention.<p></p>

         <strong>Elaboration:</strong> A lot of platform fighters games are very similar and the issue of game uniqueness arises.<p></p>
         
         <strong>Constraints:</strong> none<p></p>
         
         <strong>Effort Estimation:</strong> 4 person-hours<p></p>
         
         <strong>Acceptance test:</strong> The game will be visibly different from other platform fighter games including platform and character changes.<p></p>
