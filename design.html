         FrostFyte works by tying all processes to a single stockpile of <b>scripts</b>.<br><br>
         
         These scripts are influenced by player input (<b>administrator</b>), and allow players to engage with what Game Maker Engine calls <b>rooms</b>, which refers to both stages and menus. <br><br>
         
         These menus impact <b>stage and character processes</b>, including character & stage selection. <br><br>
         
         Both stages and characters fall back into the script stockpile, which impacts things like <b>damage, knockback, knockouts, and general physics</b> when influenced by player inputs. <br><br>
         
         The scripts and character processes also draw on the <b>sprite</b> stockpile, which refers to all of FrostFyte’s original assets used during gameplay, including stage art, character art, and animations.

         <p>&emsp;Classes in Platform Fighter Engine play a large role, in that they’re integral to the scripts that provide characters with their functions. Fighters function as classes, and within their declarations, they’re given a number of stats determining things like movement speed on the ground and in the air. <br>&emsp;In addition, these “classes” have access to a number of other scripts, assigning properties and animations to moves. These classes are not singleton, as they’re called in a variety of functions necessary for character selection.</p>
